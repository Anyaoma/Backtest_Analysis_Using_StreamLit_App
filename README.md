# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF THE ENGULFING AND RSI STRATEGY, USING STREAMLIT 

This is a Streamlit app for displaying the backtest result of a combined ENGULFING and RSI strategy. This project can be conducted using any strategy of choice. This is a personal project undertaken to have a bird's-eye view of the performance of this strategy using just a link. 
Disclaimer: The code is hosted on the Streamlit Cloud (free), which can be extremely slow to load. An alternative option is the Heroku cloud- a paid and faster option.
